      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hey there! My name is Luke and I'm an aspiring Web Dev,
      recently graduated from the Full-Stack bootcamp at V School in downtown SLC, UT.
      My hobbies include watching horror films, playing video games and listening to music
      (primarily thrash/death metal & hip hop). I'm consistently expanding my skillset via courses on
      PluralSight and Udemy -- as the development field is constantly evolving.
      Please see below for links to my social media, portfolio (links to Github repositories on project pages) and contact information.</p>
